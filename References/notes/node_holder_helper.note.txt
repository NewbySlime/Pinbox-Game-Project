node_holder_helper has features more than just storing node address memory, like:
  Object freeing listening;
    When a node is freeing (or freed), another node that referenced it doesn't know if it already freed.
    Thus this class is to help this problem. The class will listen to the node and act accordingly, by referencing NULL to a variable in the class that referencing to that node.
    NOTE: This method needs to bind the node and also giving the detail of the node beforehand.
