Change of scenes will be handled by game_handler.
Every change of the scenes also have the context codes that dictates what kind of scenes the game should handle.

A folder called "game_context_scenes" list of folders that are dedicated for each context code.
game_handler will emit a signal that notifies the connected node that the game_handler will change to certain context and the listener will have to complain.

"game_context_listener_helper" is a helper that will listen to game_handler change of context and will change to appropriate scenes. Classes that use this should node_holder_helper and always check if the object is NULL.
